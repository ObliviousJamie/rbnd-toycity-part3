How long did you spend working on this project?
Roughly 2-3 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The logic of returning items was the most challenging however as it meant having a few compatible methods in multiple classes.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
1. Additonal fields in Products (Damaged and department). The user can break, and search by department with these
2. A feature to allow users to return items unless damaged
I chose these as they seemed to be useful for the client, and I felt that the code for returning items would be rewarding.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Using more of Ruby's one line comments and removing redundent or long-winded code.
